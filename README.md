## What
- a library for recognizing hand gestures
- a set of example scripts that capture a video stream from a camera, run gesture recognition and simulate input devices (by scrolling, clicking etc)

## Why
For health related reasons, I had to stop using a mouse and a keyboard. [Talon](https://talonvoice.com/) allowed me to type with my voice and move the cursor with my eyes. This project was started to complement this setup with hand gestures.
